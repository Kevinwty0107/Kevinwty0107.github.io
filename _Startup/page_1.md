### Situation

The renewable energy ecosystem consists of renewable
generation, smart grids, utilisation, and energy storage
and is the most important resource in the path to
net zero carbon emissions. Currently, 30% of global
electricity has been generated from renewables,
including wind, solar, hydro, ocean, and biomass,
transferred through smart grid, and distributed to
storage and utilisation. However, over $50 billion
is spent on operation and maintenance (O&M) for
renewable infrastructures each year, due to the lack
of proper O&M strategies. For instance, the O&M costs
comprise 30% of the total capital cost in offshore wind.
While these costs remain a significant obstacle, they
also present a huge market opportunity for intelligent
O&M with great growth potential.
