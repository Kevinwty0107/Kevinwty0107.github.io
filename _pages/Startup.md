PowerSense has rapidly positioned itself as an innovative force within the renewable energy sector, particularly in operational and maintenance (O&M) optimization. By addressing the significant expenses associated with passive maintenance strategies—characterized by delayed fault detection and inefficient troubleshooting—PowerSense offers a groundbreaking intelligent O&M software platform. This platform is underpinned by extensive research in renewable modeling and machine learning, enabling predictive maintenance that promises to drastically reduce costs and enhance efficiency in renewable energy production. With the advent of our platform, we aim to transform the current O&M landscape, marked by annual expenditures exceeding $50 billion, by leveraging advanced algorithms to predict potential failures and optimize maintenance schedules, thus ensuring the stable and efficient operation of renewable energy infrastructures.

Our journey has been marked by significant achievements and support from leading investors and institutions. PowerSense has successfully raised over **$600,000** in funding from notable entities such as **MiraclePlus (formerly Y-Combinator China)** and Shenzhen Baoan Doctorate Association Capital, underscoring the confidence in our vision and technology. Additionally, our innovative approach has been recognized on prestigious platforms; we clinched the runner-up position at a global startup competition held in Shenzhen Baoan, China, and were honored as one of the ["21 to Watch"](https://www.cofinitive.com/shortlist-2023/) 2023 – a shortlist highlighting the next generation of Cambridge game-changers poised for future success. Furthermore, we are thrilled to have won the 2nd prize at the Chris Abell Startup competition, a testament to our potential and impact. This accolade, sponsored by Cambridge Enterprise and Cambridge Innovation Capital, not only celebrates our technological innovation but also the collaborative spirit of my co-founder, Borong Hu, and our team. 

As PowerSense continues to navigate the renewable energy landscape, these recognitions and the support from our investors fuel our commitment to developing sustainable, efficient solutions for the renewable energy sector.
