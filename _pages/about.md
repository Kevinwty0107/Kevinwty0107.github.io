I am a third-year PhD Student at the [Department of Computer Science and Technology](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/), [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/). My research interests are deeply rooted in Reinforcement Learning, Machine Learning, Machine Learning Systems, and the enhancement of database systems through machine learning techniques. I have the privilege of being advised by [Dr. Eiko Yoneki](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~ey204/) from the System Research Group at the [Computer Lab](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/directions/), where we aim to push the boundaries of our field.

Prior to my current studies, I completed my Bachelor's Degree in Physics at Peking University, Beijing, China, where I graduated with honors and a minor in math During my tenure there, I was honored with the **Excellent Graduate Student Award** from the School of Physics and received recognition for my **Excellent Graduation Thesis**. My engagement in the academic community was further acknowledged through awards like the **Special Award at the 5th Youth Physical Tournament**, underscoring my dedication and achievement in the field. This period of academic excellence was supported by a full scholarship **Third Prize in the Freshman Scholarship**, a testament to my commitment and performance. Following my undergraduate studies, I pursued a Master's Degree in Engineering at Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA, where I graduated as the top 1 student of my class.
