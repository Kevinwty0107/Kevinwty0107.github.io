I am a third-year PhD Student from the [Department of Computer Science and Technology](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/), [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/). My research interest includes Reinforcement Learning, Machine Learning, Machine Learning System, Machine-learning Enhanced Database Systems.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Dr.Eiko Yoneki](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~ey204/) of System Research Group from [Computer Lab](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/directions/),University of Cambridge. Before Cambridge, I finished my Bachelor's Degree at Peking University, Beijing, China, graduated with honor degrees and minored in math. Then I obtained my Master Degree of Engineering at Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA.
