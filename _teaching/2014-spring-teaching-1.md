The aim of this course is to provide an introduction to some fundamental issues and algorithms in artificial intelligence (AI). The course approaches AI from an algorithmic, computer science-centric perspective; relatively little reference is made to the complementary perspectives developed within psychology, neuroscience or elsewhere. The course aims to provide some fundamental tools and algorithms required to produce AI systems able to exhibit limited human-like abilities, particularly in the form of problem solving by search, game-playing, representing and reasoning with knowledge, planning, and learning.
